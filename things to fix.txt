+++ add the is_home_side to the player_performance
+++ make sure yellow cards is not the same as fouls conceded
+ when a player scores a penalty goal and another goal (see match 3378, or 9526, or 7333), all the goals are 
	counted as penalty goals. This does not happen often, so no need to rescrape every detail
	of every match.
	Modify the results scraper not to mix up goals and penalty goals when a player scores
	both types of goals. Then use the penalty goals query to see which matches are affected
+ check the yellow cards and find out why is the total # of yellow cards different
+ check the red cards and find out why is it different from the club red cards found in their page
+ check own goals

match_id = 66525 (this one seems ok?)
